Healthcare Diabetes Prediction

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a healthcare dataset. The dataset contains patient health metrics such as Age, BMI, HbA1c, Cholesterol, and more, along with a target variable (CLASS) indicating whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzed trends and correlations in key features (Age, BMI, HbA1c, Cholesterol).
- Visualized distributions and identified outliers.

2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values (removed incomplete rows).
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Gender).
- Standardized numerical features for model improvement.

3. Machine Learning Modeling:
- Defined features (X) and target (y).
- Split data into training/testing sets.
- Trained models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

4. Model Evaluation:
- Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected best-performing model for diabetes prediction.

## Key Insights:
- Age: Older patients had a higher diabetes risk.
- Cholesterol: High levels were common in diabetics.
- HbA1c Distribution: A significant portion of the population has elevated HbA1c levels.

## Best Model:
Random Forest Model had the highest accuracy.
